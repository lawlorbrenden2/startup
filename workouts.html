             results for the day. Additionally, when creating the workout plan, the user will be able

                    The bar should be directly over the shoulders. Press your feet firmly into the ground and keep your hips on the bench throughout 
                    the entire movement. Keep your core engaged and maintain a neutral spine position throughout the movement. A
                    void arching your back.Slowly lift the bar or dumbbells off the rack, if using. Lower the bar to the chest, about nipple level, 
                    allowing elbows to bend out to the side, about 45 degrees away from the body.Stop lowering when your elbows are just below the bench."
                    Press feet into the floor as you push the bar back up to return to starting position."
