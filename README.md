# FlexBook

[My Notes](notes.md)

FlexBook is a fitness tracking app that allows users to connect and share their personal progress with others. Add and customize specialized workouts and view your progress over time. Check and react to the progress of your friends. Celebrate together as everyone works towards their getting their gains.


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to track your workouts and fitness goals but also those of your friends? FlexBook allows you to track your progress and track the progess of others. Each user can implement custom workouts and record their results, and then view the results of others. Once someone has reached an important milestone or recorded a personal best, they can choose to notify their friends through putting their results on their friend's feed.

### Design

Note: All of these sketches are done on a mobile phone as that is what I imagine the primary device type used would be for this type of web app, but I will design a proper web interface for a computer as well.
