### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to track your workouts and fitness goals but also those of your friends? FlexBook allows you to track your progress and track the progess of others. Each user can implement custom workouts and record their results, and then view the results of others. Once someone has reached an important milestone or recorded a personal best, they can choose to notify their friends through putting their results on their friend's feed.
